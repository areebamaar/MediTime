# MediTrak
An Android app that helps users keep track of their medications.

### Requirements:

  + Android 8.0 Oreo or newer
  + 15 MB storage

### Getting Started:

  + To install the app, go the releases tab and selected the latest pre-release version of the app. Your Android device my require you to give your browser permission to download an APK from it instead of the Play Store.
  + Alternatively, to get the newest (and possibly unstable version) you can clone the repo then in Android Studio: Build -> Build Bundle(s)/APK(s) -> Build APK(s). You can then transfer the APK to your phone however you want and use the app.
  + Eventually I do plan on releasing this app on Google Play, but it still has a couple rough patchs that need ironing out before it's ready for that.

### Status:
  
  + In active development, this app is a personal project that I work on in my freetime.
  + The app is largely functioning as intended with notifications and nvaigation to past and future weeks being fully functional. Most of the updates I'm planning will have to do more with styling than new features, however I do have a couple ideas for how to make the app more helpful in the works.
